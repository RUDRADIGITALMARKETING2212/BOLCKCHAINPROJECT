const questions = [
  {q:"What is carbon footprint?", a:"A carbon footprint is the total amount of greenhouse gases, mainly COâ‚‚, released due to human activities like driving, electricity usage, and consumption habits."},
  {q:"How is carbon footprint calculated?", a:"It is calculated by measuring emissions from activities such as travel, energy consumption, food habits, and product usage, often expressed in tonnes of COâ‚‚ per year."},
  {q:"How much COâ‚‚ is released by driving a car?", a:"On average, a car emits about 0.25 kg of COâ‚‚ per kilometer driven."},
  {q:"What is the carbon footprint of charging a mobile phone?", a:"Charging a smartphone produces a very small amount of COâ‚‚, approximately 8â€“10 grams per full charge."},
  {q:"How can I reduce my carbon footprint?", a:"Use public transport, adopt renewable energy, reduce meat consumption, use energy-efficient appliances, and recycle materials."},
  {q:"What is the average carbon footprint in India?", a:"The average carbon footprint in India is about 1.9 tonnes per person per year, much lower than the global average."},
  {q:"Do LED bulbs reduce COâ‚‚ emissions?", a:"Yes, LED bulbs consume less electricity, indirectly reducing COâ‚‚ emissions from power plants."},
  {q:"How much pollution comes from flights?", a:"A short-haul flight emits about 255g COâ‚‚ per km per passenger, while long flights can produce more."},
  {q:"How does solar energy reduce carbon footprint?", a:"Solar panels generate electricity without burning fossil fuels, reducing COâ‚‚ emissions by up to 60% compared to conventional sources."},
  {q:"How do plastic bottles affect the environment?", a:"Plastic bottles contribute to COâ‚‚ emissions during production and disposal, and pollute oceans and landfills."},
  {q:"What are the carbon emissions of eating meat?", a:"Producing meat generates significantly more COâ‚‚ than plant-based foods; reducing meat intake can lower your footprint."},
  {q:"How does recycling help?", a:"Recycling reduces the need for raw materials, saving energy and lowering COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"What is the effect of deforestation?", a:"Deforestation increases carbon in the atmosphere as trees no longer absorb COâ‚‚, worsening climate change."},
  {q:"Can using public transport reduce carbon footprint?", a:"Yes, buses and trains emit far less COâ‚‚ per passenger than cars."},
  {q:"How does water usage impact carbon footprint?", a:"Energy used to treat and heat water contributes to COâ‚‚ emissions; using less water reduces your footprint."},
  {q:"Do electric vehicles reduce emissions?", a:"Electric vehicles produce less COâ‚‚ than conventional cars, especially if charged with renewable energy."},
  {q:"How much COâ‚‚ is produced by home heating?", a:"Heating a home with fossil fuels releases COâ‚‚; switching to renewable energy reduces emissions."},
  {q:"What is carbon offsetting?", a:"Carbon offsetting involves funding projects like tree planting to compensate for your COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"How can diet affect carbon footprint?", a:"Plant-based diets generally have a lower carbon footprint compared to meat-heavy diets."},
  {q:"Do reusable bags help?", a:"Yes, using reusable bags reduces the need for plastic production, saving COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"How does air conditioning impact carbon footprint?", a:"AC units consume electricity, often produced by fossil fuels, increasing COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"What is the impact of fast fashion?", a:"Fast fashion creates high COâ‚‚ emissions due to production, transportation, and disposal of clothes."},
  {q:"Can planting trees help?", a:"Trees absorb COâ‚‚ from the atmosphere, reducing overall carbon levels."},
  {q:"How does commuting by bike affect carbon footprint?", a:"Cycling produces zero COâ‚‚ and reduces emissions from vehicles."},
  {q:"Does eating locally reduce emissions?", a:"Yes, local food reduces transportation-related COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"What is greenhouse gas?", a:"Greenhouse gases like COâ‚‚ and methane trap heat in the atmosphere, contributing to climate change."},
  {q:"How does meat production affect environment?", a:"Meat production emits methane, a potent greenhouse gas, and requires large land and water resources."},
  {q:"Do wind turbines reduce COâ‚‚?", a:"Yes, wind energy generates electricity without COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"How much COâ‚‚ is produced by laptops?", a:"Using laptops consumes electricity; over their lifetime, they produce COâ‚‚ depending on energy source."},
  {q:"What is sustainable living?", a:"Sustainable living is adopting habits that reduce resource consumption and carbon emissions."},
  {q:"How does food waste impact carbon footprint?", a:"Wasted food represents wasted energy and COâ‚‚ emissions from production and transportation."},
  {q:"Can using solar water heaters help?", a:"Yes, solar water heaters reduce reliance on electricity or gas, lowering COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"Do hybrid cars save emissions?", a:"Hybrid cars consume less fuel and produce lower COâ‚‚ emissions than conventional vehicles."},
  {q:"What is carbon neutrality?", a:"Carbon neutrality is balancing emitted COâ‚‚ with reductions or offsets to achieve net-zero emissions."},
  {q:"Does air travel affect climate?", a:"Yes, air travel emits large amounts of COâ‚‚ and contrails that contribute to climate change."},
  {q:"Can LED street lights help cities?", a:"LED street lights use less energy, reducing urban COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"How does urban gardening help?", a:"Urban gardening absorbs COâ‚‚, reduces transportation needs, and promotes sustainability."},
  {q:"Are paper straws better?", a:"Yes, paper straws reduce plastic production and associated COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"What is lifecycle emissions?", a:"Lifecycle emissions are all COâ‚‚ produced from manufacturing, use, and disposal of a product."},
  {q:"Can telecommuting reduce carbon footprint?", a:"Working from home reduces commuting emissions, lowering overall carbon footprint."},
  {q:"How does packaging affect emissions?", a:"Excessive packaging requires energy to produce and transport, increasing COâ‚‚ emissions."},
  {q:"What is renewable energy?", a:"Renewable energy comes from natural sources like sun, wind, and water, producing minimal COâ‚‚."},
  {q:"How does carpooling help?", a:"Carpooling reduces the number of vehicles on the road, cutting COâ‚‚ emissions per person."}
